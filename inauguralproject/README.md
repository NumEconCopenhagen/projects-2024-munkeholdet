# Inaugural project

Out project is titled **Inagural Project** and is about an exchange economy model featuring two individuals. We depict the pareto improvement set and optimizes the model to identy market-clearing prices and optimal allocations. Lastly, we consider scenarios with random initial endowments and scrutinize the ensuing market equilibrium allocations.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb). We find that the pareto improvement depicted by the edgeworth box makes both individuals better off,we find different optimal prices and belonging utilities depending on the different analyzed scenarios and depict all of these in a diagram. Lastly we simulate a scenario with random initial endowments and highlight the trade-offs between the goods and the diverse market conditions.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
