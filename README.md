**The use of AI:**
We have used AI for structural purposes, for coding error correction and ideas, and overall proffreading.

Our project is titled Model Project and is about the general Solow model with an extension of endogenous technological growth. We analyze the effect on long-run capital and output per capita, of changes in initial value guesses and parameter changes. The extension gives a further and more nuanced understanding of economic growth.

The results of the project can be seen from running modelproject.ipynb. We find that technological level and output elasticity of capital has the strongest effect on capital and output per capita in steady state, and that an increased technological growth rate, increases the economys ability to reach steady state faster.

Dependencies: Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
