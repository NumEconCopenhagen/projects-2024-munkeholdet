    "# The Solow Model\n",
    "The Solow Model is a cornerstone macroeconomic framework that analyzes the determinants of long-term economic growth. This model focuses on how different factors such as capital accumulation, labor force characteristics, and technological advancements contribute to the output of an economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions of the Solow Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model simplifies the complexity of real economies by making several key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Representative Firm**: The economy consists of a single, representative firm.\n",
    "- **Fixed Labor Force**: The total number of workers (labor force) is constant.\n",
    "- **Constant Returns to Scale**: The production function is homogeneous of degree one, implying that scaling all inputs by a constant factor results in output scaling by the same factor.\n",
    "- **Diminishing Returns to Capital**: As capital stock increases while other factors remain fixed, each additional unit of capital produces less additional output.\n",
    "- **Closed Economy**: The economy does not engage in trade, meaning there are no imports or exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Variables and Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ Y $ = Output, commonly referred to as Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n",
    "- $ K $ = Capital stock, the total accumulation of produced means of production.\n",
    "- $ L $ = Labor force, the total number of workers available for production.\n",
    "- $ A $ = Technological progress, also known as total factor productivity (TFP).\n",
    "- $ s $ = Savings rate, defined as the proportion of output that is saved and reinvested.\n",
    "- $ \\delta $ = Depreciation rate, the rate at which capital stock depreciates.\n",
    "- $ n $ = Growth rate of the labor force.\n",
    "- $ \\alpha $ (alpha) = Output elasticity of capital, representing capital's contribution to output.\n",
    "- $ 1 - \\alpha $ = Output elasticity of labor, representing labor's contribution to output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Representation of the Production Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The production function can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = A K^\\alpha L^{1-\\alpha}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function shows how output (Y) is determined by the levels of capital (K), labor (L), and technological progress (A). The parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(1 - \\alpha\\) represent the output elasticities of capital and labor, respectively, indicating how sensitive output is to changes in each input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Equations of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's dynamics are driven by the equations of capital accumulation and technological growth:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capital Accumulation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dK}{dt} = sY - \\delta K\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This differential equation describes how the capital stock evolves over time, where $sY$ is the total investment from saving a fraction $s$ of output, and $\\delta K$ is the loss of capital due to depreciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technological Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming exogenous technological progress, the growth rate of technology ($g$) is constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dA}{dt} = gA\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be further analyzed to derive steady-state solutions and to explore the impact of changes in parameters like the savings rate, depreciation rate, and technology growth rate on the long-term economic growth of the economy.\n"

    "## Steady-State \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Solow growth model, the steady-state represents a condition where the capital stock per capita remains constant over time, implying that the economy has reached an equilibrium level of capital that neither increases nor decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steady-State Capital per Capita\n",
    "\n",
    "The steady-state capital per capita is given by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k^* = \\frac{s(1 - n)}{\\delta + g} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $k^* $ = steady-state capital per capita\n",
    "- $ s $ = savings rate\n",
    "- $ n $ = labor force growth rate\n",
    "- $ \\delta $ = depreciation rate of capital\n",
    "- $ g $ = rate of technological progress\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Economic Interpretation:\n",
    "This equation shows that the steady-state capital per capita depends inversely on the sum of the depreciation rate and the technological progress rate. A higher savings rate or a lower labor growth rate leads to higher steady-state capital per capita, ceteris paribus. The denominator, \\( \\delta + g \\), indicates that faster depreciation of capital or faster technological progress both require higher savings to maintain the same level of capital per capita, as new technology might make existing capital obsolete faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steady-State Output per Capita\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the steady-state capital per capita, the steady-state output per capita can be derived as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y^* = A \\left(\\frac{s(1 - n)}{\\delta + g}\\right)^\\alpha $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ y^* $ = steady-state output per capita\n",
    "- $ A $ = initial level of technology\n",
    "- $ \\alpha $ = output elasticity of capital, representing how output increases with an increase in capital\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Economic Interpretation:\n",
    "This formula demonstrates how the level of technology amplifies the effects of capital per capita on output per capita. The term $\\left(\\frac{s(1 - n)}{\\delta + g}\\right)^\\alpha$ shows that output per capita is more responsive to changes in the capital-labor ratio in economies where capital is a more significant factor in production ($\\alpha$ is large). Moreover, higher technological levels (represented by $A$) directly increase output per capita by making each unit of capital more productive.\n"

    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Technology\n",
    "- **Impact**: Increasing technology from 1.00 to 2.00 leads to substantial increases in both capital and output. For example, technology at 1.50 results in a capital of 6,745,948.78 and an output of 167.80, while at 2.00, these values rise to 7,919,647.25 and 234.77 respectively.\n",
    "- **Economic Interpretation**: Higher technology levels directly enhance the productivity of capital and labor, leading to higher output. This reflects the crucial role of technological advancements in economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Savings Rate\n",
    "- **Impact**: Changes in the savings rate from 0.30 to 0.50 do not affect the steady-state values of capital and output, all remaining at 7,919,647.25 for capital and 234.77 for output.\n",
    "- **Economic Interpretation**: The invariance of steady-state values despite changes in the savings rate suggests that the model might be assuming a perfectly elastic supply of savings or that other factors, such as output elasticity and technology, are dominating the effects of savings changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Depreciation Rate\n",
    "- **Impact**: Variations in the depreciation rate from 0.05 to 0.07 show no change in the steady-state outcomes.\n",
    "- **Economic Interpretation**: The stability of capital and output in response to changes in depreciation rate indicates that the economy's growth is not sensitive to the rate at which capital depreciates, possibly due to a compensating factor in the production function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Labor Growth Rate\n",
    "- **Impact**: Adjusting the labor growth rate from 0.02 to 0.04 also does not alter the steady-state results.\n",
    "- **Economic Interpretation**: Similar to depreciation, the unchanging steady-state results suggest that labor growth does not critically impact the long-term capital and output levels, likely due to the fixed proportion of output elasticity in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Technological Growth Rate\n",
    "- **Impact**: No change in steady-state values with tech growth rate variations.\n",
    "- **Economic Interpretation**: This indicates that short-term changes in technology growth rates do not significantly influence the long-term equilibrium of the economy within this model framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Output Elasticity\n",
    "- **Impact**: Significant changes are observed when varying output elasticity. Increasing from 0.30 to 0.50 causes exponential increases in both capital and output.\n",
    "- **Economic Interpretation**: Output elasticity represents how responsive the output is to changes in capital. Higher elasticity values mean that output is more sensitive to capital increases, leading to much larger outputs as capital increases. This highlights the pivotal role of capital's productivity in driving economic growth.\n",

    "### Effects of Standard Economic Parameters:\n",
    "- **Savings Rate (s), Depreciation Rate (δ), and Labor Force Growth Rate (n)**:\n",
    "  The steady-state levels of capital and output per capita are invariant to changes in the savings rate, depreciation rate, and labor force growth rate. Adjustments in these parameters affect the speed of convergence rather than the long-term equilibrium levels. For instance, a higher savings rate accelerates the accumulation of capital, thus shortening the time required to reach the steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Influence of Productivity and Capital Elasticity:\n",
    "- **Total Factor Productivity (A) and Output Elasticity of Capital (α)**:\n",
    "  Increasing total factor productivity or the output elasticity of capital elevates the steady state levels of both capital and output per capita. A higher total factor productivity enhances the effectiveness of both labor and capital in producing output, thereby raising the output for any given level of capital and labor. Similarly, an increase in the output elasticity of capital means that output becomes more sensitive to changes in the capital stock, leading to higher output levels at equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension Involving Technological Growth Rate:\n",
    "- **Impact of Technological Growth Rate (g)**:\n",
    "  Our extended analysis includes adjusting the growth rate of technology, as depicted in the provided graph. Increasing the technological growth rate enhances the economy's ability to reach its steady state faster. This is shown by the steep initial increase in steady-state capital as the technological growth rate improves. Although higher growth rates accelerate convergence, the ultimate steady-state levels remain unaffected. Conversely, a lower technological growth rate results in a slower approach to the steady state, prolonging the period of economic adjustment.\n",
